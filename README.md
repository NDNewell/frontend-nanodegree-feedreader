## Feed Reader Project

### Overview
------------

* This project consisted of being given a web-based application that reads RSS
  feeds. The original developer included an incomplete testing suite using [
  Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). The project aim was to complete the
  testing suite by writing tests that pass.

### Instructions
----------------

* Run index.html in your browser

  or

* Open https://github.com/NDNewell/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader


#### Tests Created:

* Wrote a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures
it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.

* Wrote a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures
it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.

* Wrote a new test suite named "The menu".

* Wrote a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default.

* Wrote a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is
clicked.

* Wrote a test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes
its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container
(used Jasmine's beforeEach and asynchronous done() functions).

* Wrote a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function
that the content actually changes (used Jasmine's beforeEach and asynchronous
done() functions).
